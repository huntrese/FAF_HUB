This course gives an introduction to probability and basics of applied
statistics and not only. We will cover topics from Discrete and Continuous
Probability, Combinatorics, Statistics, Random Processes and Information
Theory. On completion of this course, you will understand and have the ability
to apply special models, methods and tools to analyze problems and data with
an uncertainty component. Probability in a complex world become an important
part of scientific literacy together with mathematics, physics or computer
science.

Here are some advice to follow if you want to **survive** (get a passing
grade) this class:

  1. Visit the course page on a daily basis.
  2. Attend classes, seminars and labs. 
  3. Read all lecture slides and recommended reading (even if it is not mandatory). Ask questions. This can be done either during and after the class or during online office hours that will be scheduled.
  4. Do the homework. 
  5. Do the homework by yourself. 
  6. After your are done with the homework and submitted it, check if you did it correctly/completely. Self-assessment is very important, especially in individual learning.
  7. Spent at least 2 hours per day studying for this course. 
  8. Do the homework and projects, and make sure they are submitted at deadline.
  9. Browse the literature I suggested and read even more than it is given in the lectures. There is no such thing as enough reading.
  10. Ask questions!
  11. DO NOT CHEAT! There are many ways to verify if you cheated or not. Remember, both person who cheated and person who helped the cheater will be sanctioned.
  12. You can and should help your colleagues by informing them on the updates and announcements made on this page, explaining to them the class material and solutions to homework problems. But, you must not give them the answers to quizzes, exams, or doing their projects.

The mandatory readings are the lecture slides and possible additional pdf
files given in every chapter. The lecture slides are based (but not entirely)
on two textbooks: ****

  1. **Introduction to Probability** C.M. Grinstead and J.L. Snell
  2. **Mathematics for Computer Science,** by E. Lehman, T. Leighton and A.R. Meyer. (Some Chapters from Part III and Part IV)
**READ IT!**

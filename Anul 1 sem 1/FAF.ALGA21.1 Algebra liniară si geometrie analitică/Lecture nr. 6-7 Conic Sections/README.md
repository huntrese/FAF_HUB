discovered on March 27, 2020, by astronomers during the NEOWISE mission of the
Wide-field  
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) space telescope.

Comet NEOWISE was closest  
to Earth on July 23, 2020, 01:09 UT, passing  
some 64 million miles (103 million km) from  
our planet. Many observers have reported  
that - once you spot it with binoculars - you  
can remove them and glimpse this comet as  
a fuzzy object, using only the unaided eye.

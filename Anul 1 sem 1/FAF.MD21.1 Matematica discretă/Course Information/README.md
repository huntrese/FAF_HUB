This course gives an introduction to Mathematics used in Computer Science and
not only.

We will cover topics from Set Theory, Mathematical Logic, Number theory, Graph
Theory, Boolean Functions, Computability Theory.

On completion of this course, you will understand and have the ability to
apply the general methods of Mathematics (mostly discrete)

in Computer Science. You will be able to use these methods in next courses
such as Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Computer Architecture,

Formal Languages and Compilers, Information Security, Databases, Software
Engineering, Computer Networks and Systems, and many others.
**READ IT**

Here are some advice ( **Survival Guide** ) to follow if you want to get a
passing grade for this class:

  1. Come to lectures, seminars and labs. 
  2. Visit the course page on a daily basis. First see the update on what was posted.
  3. Read all lectures and recommended reading (even if it is not mandatory). Ask questions. This can be done in class, seminars or ask for a scheduled office hour (consultation) and I will organize it.
  4. Do the homework. 
  5. Do the homework by yourself. 
  6. After your are done with the homework and submitted it, check if you did it correctly/completely. Self-assessment is very important, especially in individual learning.
  7. Spent at least 2 hours per day studying for this course. 
  8. Browse the literature I suggested and read even more than it is given in the lectures. There is no such thing as enough reading.
  9. Ask questions!
  10. DO NOT CHEAT! There are many ways to verify if you cheated or not. Remember, both person who cheated and person who helped the cheater will be sanctioned.
  11. You can and should help your colleagues by informing them on the updates and announcements made on this page, explaining to them the class material and solutions to homework problems. But, you must not give them the answers to quizzes, exams, or doing their projects.

The mandatory readings are the lecture slides and additional pdf files given
in every chapter. Also, I recommend to read the recommended pages from the
textbook given below.

The individual work for computer programming course is a solo project or
assignment that you complete independently(unless you chose the hard task).
The mark you receive for this individual work is an important part of your
overall course grade, weighted as one of the mandatory five assessments(PE1,
PE2 ...).

**Things to know:**

  * The mark you get is the final mark, it won't be reviewed.
  * To get a mark, you don't necessarily need to present it, but your highest mark will be 5, however you should upload the report and code on else/github.
  * Highest mark you can get with presentation but without modifying your code is 7
  * Highest mark you can get with presentation and changes implemented during our lesson is 9, if you fail to implement the changes, it won't be a 9, it will be either 7 either 8, depending on the progress done
  * The only way to get 10 is to implement the **hard task**
  * Each week after the deadline will count as -1 from your final mark(e.g. if you are late one week, your highest mark will be 9)
  * If you don't do anything for this assignment, **don't expect a mark**

**UPDATE**

For those who had chosen the hard task, as you know, you will also get graded
for the 6th laboratory, but you will have to present the progress you made on
the individual work by 1st of December. Based on your progress you will get
the mark on 6th lab work. If you fail to present your progress, **you will not
get the mark on the 6th lab** and then the only way to get a mark on 6th lab
will be to implement it as if you didn't choose the hard task.

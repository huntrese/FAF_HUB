Task for the current laboratory work can be found în the pdf attached, read it
carefully and ask if there are any questions.

Good Luck!

UPDATE: When writing the report, instead of flowcharts, you can expand your
theoretical description on the task you implemented.

Before listing the code, state the problems that you have solved.

Base task is the problem from the [Kulev PC
SDA](https://else.fcim.utm.md/mod/resource/view.php?id=43198 "Kulev PC
SDA").pdf

In your results screenshot, you should show the results în this format:

  1. Input(n(must be greater than 50) and 2 arrays)
  2. Base problem result(on any of those 2 arrays)
  3. Problem 1 + result(+ time if applies)
  4. Problem 2 + result(+ time if applies)
  5. ...
  6. Problem N + result(+ time if applies)

For [sorting
algorithms](https://else.fcim.utm.md/mod/resource/view.php?id=28534 "SORTING
ALGORITHMS"), measure the time taken to sort the arrays

**!!!IMPORTANT** \- Use latex template provided în [Things to know about
laboratory works](https://else.fcim.utm.md/mod/feedback/view.php?id=43562) to
create/edit your report

UPDATE: starting from this moment(23.09 22:00) when you write your report,
dont include the full code în the technical implementation section(there
should be just some pseudocode), instead upload your code file în the
submission along with the pdf report

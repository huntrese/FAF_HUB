### **Read this first:**

  1. Work on the lab in the same Git Repository as the previous lab.

  2. Use git and GitHub to track your progress and for me to see your work. Via git commits, branches and frequent pushes to the repository, see point 5.

  3. The uploaded GitHub should contain laboratory #0 and this one.

  4. Every day missed after deadline date is -1 point.

  5. If something is unclear contact me in Teams. 

  6. Remember to have fun while writing the code and slowly building up the system!

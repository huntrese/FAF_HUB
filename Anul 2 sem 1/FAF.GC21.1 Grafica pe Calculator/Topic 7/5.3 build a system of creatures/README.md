Take your creature and build a system of creatures. How can they interact with
each other? Can you use inheritance and polymorphism to create a variety of
creatures, derived from the same code base? Develop a methodology for how they
compete for resources (for example, food). Can you track a creature’s “health”
much like we tracked a particle’s lifespan, removing creatures when
appropriate? What rules can you incorporate to control how creatures are born?

(Also, you might consider using a particle system itself in the design of a
creature. What happens if your emitter is tied to the creature’s location?)

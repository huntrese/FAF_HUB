Use the concept of steering forces to drive the behavior of the creatures in
your ecosystem. Some possibilities:

  * Create “schools” or “flocks” of creatures.

  * Use a seeking behavior for creatures to search for food (for chasing moving prey, consider “pursuit”).

  * Use a flow field for the ecosystem environment. For example, how does your system behave if the creatures live in a flowing river?

  * Build a creature with countless steering behaviors (as many as you can reasonably add). Think about ways to vary the weights of these behaviors so that you can dial those behaviors up and down, mixing and matching on the fly. How are creatures’ initial weights set? What rules drive how the weights change over time?

  * Complex systems can be nested. Can you design a single creature out of a flock of boids? And can you then make a flock of those creatures?

  * Complex systems can have memory (and be adaptive). Can the history of your ecosystem affect the behavior in its current state? (This could be the driving force behind how the creatures adjust their steering force weights.)

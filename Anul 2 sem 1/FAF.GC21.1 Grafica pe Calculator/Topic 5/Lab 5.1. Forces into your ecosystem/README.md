Incorporate the concept of forces into your ecosystem (you can use the
ecosystem from Task 4 point B or create something new). Try introducing other
elements into the environment (food, a predator) for the creature to interact
with. Does the creature experience attraction or repulsion to things in its
world? Can you think more abstractly and design forces based on the creatureâ€™s
desires or goals?

For help look for the [Chapter 2.
Forces](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-2-forces/).

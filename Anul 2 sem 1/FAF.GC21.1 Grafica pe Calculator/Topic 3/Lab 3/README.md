##### **a)** **Make a sketch using 3D Primitives**
[SPHERE](https://processing.org/reference/sphere_.html),
[sphereDetail()](https://processing.org/reference/sphereDetail_.html),
[BOX](https://processing.org/reference/box_.html),
[createShape()](https://processing.org/reference/createShape_.html), Quad(),
pushmatrix(), popmatrix(). Rotate them using rotateX(), rotateY(), rotateZ()
or rotate(). **Move some of figure horizontally, some of them vertically and
also move the figure on the main and secondary diagonal of the window
sketch.** ****

##### b) Make array objects with 2D and (or) 3D primitives

##### You can combine point a and b task 2 and do one sketch or separately

##### For Help watch and try the

Take one of your creatures and incorporate oscillation into its motion. You
can use the Oscillator class from Example 3.7 ([Chapter 3.
Oscillation](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-3-oscillation/)) as a
model. The Oscillator object, however, oscillates around a single point (the
middle of the window). Try oscillating around a moving point. In other words,
design a creature that moves around the screen according to location,
velocity, and acceleration. But that creature isn’t just a static shape, it’s
an oscillating body. Consider tying the speed of oscillation to the speed of
motion. Think of a butterfly’s flapping wings or the legs of an insect. Can
you make it appear that the creature’s internal mechanics (oscillation) drive
its locomotion? For a sample, check out the “AttractionArrayWithOscillation”
example with the code download.

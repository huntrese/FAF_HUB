First, solve the problem without
[heaps](https://else.fcim.utm.md/mod/resource/view.php?id=42374 "Heaps").
Analyze the response from the system.

At second stage, optimize Dijkstra's algorithm using
[Heaps](https://else.fcim.utm.md/mod/resource/view.php?id=42374 "Heaps"). DO
NOT USE PRIORITY QUEUES! Submit again. Analyze the response from the system.

At stage 3. Replace your
[heaps](https://else.fcim.utm.md/mod/resource/view.php?id=42374 "Heaps")
implementation with library functions for priority queues management. Submit
again. Analyze the response from the system.

At stage 4. Compare execution time and memory resources used for your
implementation and library functions implementation (Stage 2 / Stage 3).

Finally upload and test your implementation on ELESE Course page (problem 3,
current section)

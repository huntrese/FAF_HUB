<h2>3. <span>Key points for Radix Sort algorithm</span><span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Radix Sort <span>is a linear sorting algorithm</span>.</li>
<li><span>The time complexity of Radix Sort is O(nd)</span>, where n is the size of the array and d is the number of digits in the largest number.</li>
<li>It is <span>not an in-place sorting algorithm</span> as it requires extra additional space.</li>
<li>Radix Sort <span>is a stable sort</span> as the relative order of elements with equal values is maintained.</li>
<li><span>Radix sort can be slower than other sorting algorithms like merge sort and quick sort</span> if the operations are not efficient enough. These operations include inset and delete functions of the sub-list and the process of isolating the digits we want.</li>
<li><span>Radix sort is less flexible than other sorts as it depends on the digits or letter</span>. Radix sort needs to be rewritten if the type of data is changed.</li>

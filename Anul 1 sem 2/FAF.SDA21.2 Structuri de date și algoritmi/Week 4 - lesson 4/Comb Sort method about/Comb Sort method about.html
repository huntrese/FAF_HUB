<p><span>Comb sort</span> is a comparison based sorting algorithm and is an <span>improvement</span> to <span>Bubble Sort</span> by using the idea of <span>killing the turtles</span>. Turtle is a name given to small numbers that appear towards the end of a list. When used in a Bubble Sort, these small numbers at the end take a very long time to get to the front of the list, and hence are called turtles because of the lack of speed. <span>Turtles reduce the efficiency</span> of the Bubble Sort tremendously and hence provide a <span>scope for optimisation</span>.</p>

<p>In Bubble Sort algorithm, the <span>gap between the elements</span> that are compared is always <span>1</span>. Comb sort works on the same principles as Bubble Sort but uses a <span>larger gap</span>. The inner loop of bubble sort, where swaps happen, is modified such that <span>gap between swapped elements decreases by a shrink factor k</span> for each iteration of outer loop. This <span>shrink factor is usually taken as 1.3</span>. This constant has been found by the authors <span>Stephen Lacey</span> and <span>Richard Box</span> by testing Comb sort on over <span>200,000 random lists</span>.The iteration continues till the gap becomes 1. So the last iteration of this algorithm is same as a bubble sort iteration.</p>

<h2>Asymptotic Analysis of Radix Sort<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h2>
<p>In the Radix sort algorithm running time depends on the intermediate sorting algorithm which is counting sort.</p>
<p>If the range of digits is from 1 to k, then counting sort time complexity is O(n+k).</p>
<p>There are d passes i.e counting sort is called d time, so <span>total time complexity is O(nd+nk) =O(nd). As k=O(n)</span> and d is constant, so radix sort runs in linear time.</p>

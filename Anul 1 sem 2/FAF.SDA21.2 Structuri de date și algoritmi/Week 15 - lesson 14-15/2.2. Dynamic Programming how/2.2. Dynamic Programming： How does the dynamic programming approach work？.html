<h1 class="h1"><span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">How does the dynamic programming approach work?</span></h1>
<p>The following are the steps that the dynamic programming follows:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>It breaks down the complex problem into simpler subproblems.</li>
<li>It finds the optimal solution to these sub-problems.</li>
<li>It stores the results of subproblems (memoization). The process of storing the results of subproblems is known as memorization.</li>
<li>It reuses them so that same sub-problem is calculated more than once.</li>
<li>Finally, calculate the result of the complex problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above five steps are the basic steps for dynamic programming. The dynamic programming is applicable that are having properties such as:</p>
<p>Those problems that are having overlapping subproblems and optimal substructures. Here, optimal substructure means that the solution of optimization problems can be obtained by simply combining the optimal solution of all the subproblems.</p>
<p>In the case of dynamic programming, the space complexity would be increased as we are storing the intermediate results, but the time complexity would be decreased.</p>

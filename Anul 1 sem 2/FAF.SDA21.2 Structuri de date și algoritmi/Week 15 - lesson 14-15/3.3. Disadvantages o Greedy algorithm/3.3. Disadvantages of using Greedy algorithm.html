<h1 class="h1"><span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">Disadvantages of using Greedy algorithm</span></h1>
<p>Greedy algorithm makes decisions based on the information available at each phase without considering the broader problem. So, there might be a possibility that the greedy solution does not give the best solution for every problem.</p>
<p>It follows the local optimum choice at each stage with a intend of finding the global optimum. Let's understand through an example.</p>
<p><span>Consider the graph which is given below:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/daa/images/greedy-algorithm.png" alt="Greedy Algorithm" /><span></span></p>
<p>We have to travel from the source to the destination at the minimum cost. Since we have three feasible solutions having cost paths as 10, 20, and 5. 5 is the minimum cost path so it is the optimal solution. This is the local optimum, and in this way, we find the local optimum at each stage in order to calculate the global optimal solution.</p>

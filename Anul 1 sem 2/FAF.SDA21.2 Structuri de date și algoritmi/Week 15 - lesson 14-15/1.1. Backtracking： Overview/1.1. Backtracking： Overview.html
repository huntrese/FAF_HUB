<p>Backtracking is an algorithmic technique where the goal is to get all solutions to a problem using the <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/brute-force-cybersecurity-string-search">brute force approach</a>. It consists of building a set of all the solutions incrementally. Since a problem would have constraints, the solutions that fail to satisfy them will be removed.</p>
<p><span>It uses <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/java-recursion">recursive calling</a> to find a solution set by building a solution step by step, increasing levels with time.</span> In order to find these solutions, a search tree named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space_search">state-space tree</a> is used. In a state-space tree, each branch is a variable, and each level represents a solution.</p>
<p><span>A backtracking algorithm uses the <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/depth-first-search-intro">depth-first search</a> method</span>. When it starts exploring the solutions, a bounding function is applied so that the algorithm can check if the so-far built solution satisfies the constraints. If it does, it continues searching. If it doesn’t, the branch would be eliminated, and the algorithm goes back to the level before.</p>

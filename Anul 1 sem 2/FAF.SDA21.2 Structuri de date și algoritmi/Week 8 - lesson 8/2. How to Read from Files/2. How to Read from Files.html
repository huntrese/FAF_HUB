<h2>How to Read from Files</h2>
<p>You can read information from files into your C++ program. This is possible using stream extraction operator (&gt;&gt;). You use the operator in the same way you use it to read user input from the keyboard. However, instead of using the cin object, you use the ifstream/ fstream object.</p>
<h3>Example 3:</h3>
<pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
using namespace std;
int main() {
	fstream my_file;
	my_file.open("my_file.txt", ios::in);
	if (!my_file) {
		cout &lt;&lt; "No such file";
	}
	else {
		char ch;

		while (1) {
			my_file &gt;&gt; ch;
			if (my_file.eof())
				break;

			cout &lt;&lt; ch;
		}

	}
	my_file.close();
	return 0;
}

<p><span>Code Explanation:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Include the iostream header file in the program to use its functions.</li>
<li>Include the fstream header file in the program to use its classes.</li>
<li>Include the std namespace in the program to use its classes without calling it.</li>
<li>Call the main() function. The program logic should be added within the body of this function.</li>
<li>Create an instance of the fstream class and give it the name my_file.</li>
<li>Use the open() function to create a new file named my_file.txt. The file will be opened in the in mode for reading from it.</li>
<li>Use an if statement to check whether the file does not exist.</li>
<li>Text to print on the console if the file is not found.</li>
<li>End of the body of the if statement.</li>
<li>Use an else statement to state what to do if the file is found.</li>
<li>Create a char variable named ch.</li>
<li>Create a while loop for iterating over the file contents.</li>
<li>Write/store contents of the file in the variable ch.</li>
<li>Use an if condition and eof() function that is, end of the file, to ensure the compiler keeps on reading from the file if the end is not reached.</li>
<li>Use a break statement to stop reading from the file once the end is reached.</li>
<li>Print the contents of variable ch on the console.</li>
<li>End of the while body.</li>
<li>End of the body of the else statement.</li>
<li>Call the close() function to close the file.</li>
<li>The program must return value upon successful completion.</li>
<li>End of the body of the main() function.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<ul>
<li>With file handling, the output of a program can be sent and stored in a file.</li>
<li>A number of operations can then be applied to the data while in the file.</li>
<li>A stream is an abstraction that represents a device where input/output operations are performed.</li>
<li>A stream can be represented as either destination or source of characters of indefinite length.</li>
<li>The fstream library provides C++ programmers with methods for file handling.</li>
<li>To use the library, you must include it in your program using the #include preprocessor directive.</li>

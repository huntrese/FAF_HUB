<h3><span style="font-size: large;">Opening and closing files</span></h3>
<h4><span style="font-size: medium;">Before a file can be read from, or written to, it must be opened. When the operations are complete, the file must be closed. The operating system keeps track of the location of files that are open and will prevent other applications from trying to write to the same file at the same time.</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-size: medium;">If you open your file in a text editor to check the contents, the file will be flagged by the operating system as open. You must close the file before you attempt to write to it with your program or you may get unexpected results.</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-size: medium;">File handling modes</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-size: medium;">Most systems allow you to open files in different modes. This is designed to protect the file from unplanned operations. Common modes are:</span></h4>

<h1><span style="font-size: large;">File handling functions</span></h1>
<h4><span style="font-size: medium;">Most programming languages have a built-in library of functions that allow you to work with text files. There may be other modules that can be imported for specialist file handling applications. It is a good idea to familiarise yourself with the basic functions before you start your practical work.</span></h4>

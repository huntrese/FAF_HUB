<h1 class="h1"><span style="font-size: 1.75rem;">Types of Tree data structure</span></h1>
<p><span>The following are the types of a tree data structure:</span></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><span>General tree:</span> The general tree is one of the types of tree data structures. In the general tree, a node can have either 0 or maximum n number of nodes. There is no restriction imposed on the degree of the node (the number of nodes that a node can contain). The topmost node in a general tree is known as a root node. The children of the parent node are known as <span><em>subtrees</em></span>.<br /><img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/types-of-tree1.png" alt="Tree" /><br />There can be <span><em>n</em></span> number of subtrees in a general tree. In the general tree, the subtrees are unordered as the nodes in the subtree cannot be ordered.<br />Every non-empty tree has a downward edge, and these edges are connected to the nodes known as <span><em>child nodes</em></span>. The root node is labeled with level 0. The nodes that have the same parent are known as <span><em>siblings</em></span>.</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/binary-tree">Binary tree</a>:</span> Here, binary name itself suggests two numbers, i.e., 0 and 1. In a binary tree, each node in a tree can have utmost two child nodes. Here, utmost means whether the node has 0 nodes, 1 node or 2 nodes.<br /><img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/ds/images/types-of-tree2.png" alt="Tree" /><br /><span>To know more about the binary tree, click on the link given below:</span><br /><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/binary-tree">https://www.javatpoint.com/binary-tree</a></li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/binary-search-tree">Binary Search tree</a>:</span> Binary search tree is a non-linear data structure in which one node is connected to <span><em>n</em></span> number of nodes. It is a node-based data structure. A node can be represented in a binary search tree with three fields, i.e., data part, left-child, and right-child. A node can be connected to the utmost two child nodes in a binary search tree, so the node contains two pointers (left child and right child pointer).<br />Every node in the left subtree must contain a value less than the value of the root node, and the value of each node in the right subtree must be bigger than the value of the root node.</li>
</ul>
<p>A node can be created with the help of a user-defined data type known as <span><em>struct,</em></span> as shown below:</p>
<div class="codeblock">
<div class="dp-highlighter">
<div class="bar">
<div class="tools"></div>
</div>
<ol start="1" class="dp-j">
<li class="alt"><span>struct node  </span></li>
<li><span>{  </span></li>
<li class="alt"><span>    <span class="keyword">int</span><span> data;  </span></span></li>
<li><span>    struct node *left;  </span></li>
<li class="alt"><span>struct node *right;   </span></li>
<li><span>}  </span></li>
</ol></div>
</div>
<p>The above is the node structure with three fields: data field, the second field is the left pointer of the node type, and the third field is the right pointer of the node type.</p>

<ul class="points">
<li><span><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/avl-tree">AVL tree</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p>It is one of the types of the binary tree, or we can say that it is a variant of the binary search tree. AVL tree satisfies the property of the <span><em>binary tree</em></span> as well as of the <span><em>binary search tree</em></span>. It is a self-balancing binary search tree that was invented by <span><em>Adelson Velsky Lindas</em></span>. Here, self-balancing means that balancing the heights of left subtree and right subtree. This balancing is measured in terms of the <span><em>balancing factor</em></span>.</p>
<p>We can consider a tree as an AVL tree if the tree obeys the binary search tree as well as a balancing factor. The balancing factor can be defined as the <span><em>difference between the height of the left subtree and the height of the right subtree</em></span>. The balancing factor's value must be either 0, -1, or 1; therefore, each node in the AVL tree should have the value of the balancing factor either as 0, -1, or 1.</p>

<ul class="points">
<li><span><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/red-black-tree">Red-Black Tree</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The red-Black tree</span> is the binary search tree. The prerequisite of the Red-Black tree is that we should know about the binary search tree. In a binary search tree, the value of the left-subtree should be less than the value of that node, and the value of the right-subtree should be greater than the value of that node. As we know that the time complexity of binary search in the average case is log<sub>2</sub>n, the best case is O(1), and the worst case is O(n).</p>
<p>When any operation is performed on the tree, we want our tree to be balanced so that all the operations like searching, insertion, deletion, etc., take less time, and all these operations will have the time complexity of <span><em>log<sub>2</sub>n.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>The red-black tree</em></span> is a self-balancing binary search tree. AVL tree is also a height balancing binary search tree then <span>why do we require a Red-Black tree</span>. In the AVL tree, we do not know how many rotations would be required to balance the tree, but in the Red-black tree, a maximum of 2 rotations are required to balance the tree. It contains one extra bit that represents either the red or black color of a node to ensure the balancing of the tree.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><span>Splay tree</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The splay tree data structure is also binary search tree in which recently accessed element is placed at the root position of tree by performing some rotation operations. Here, <span><em>splaying</em></span> means the recently accessed node. It is a <span><em>self-balancing</em></span> binary search tree having no explicit balance condition like <span>AVL</span> tree.</p>
<p>It might be a possibility that height of the splay tree is not balanced, i.e., height of both left and right subtrees may differ, but the operations in splay tree takes order of <span>logN</span> time where <span>n</span> is the number of nodes.</p>
<p>Splay tree is a balanced tree but it cannot be considered as a height balanced tree because after each operation, rotation is performed which leads to a balanced tree.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li><span>Treap</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Treap data structure came from the Tree and Heap data structure. So, it comprises the properties of both Tree and Heap data structures. In Binary search tree, each node on the left subtree must be equal or less than the value of the root node and each node on the right subtree must be equal or greater than the value of the root node. In heap data structure, both right and left subtrees contain larger keys than the root; therefore, we can say that the root node contains the lowest value.</p>
<p>In treap data structure, each node has both <span><em>key</em></span> and <span><em>priority</em></span> where key is derived from the Binary search tree and priority is derived from the heap data structure.</p>
<p>The <span>Treap</span> data structure follows two properties which are given below:</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Right child of a node&gt;=current node and left child of a node &lt;=current node (binary tree)</li>
<li>Children of any subtree must be greater than the node (heap)</li>
</ul>
<ul class="points">
<li><span><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/b-tree">B-tree</a></span></li>
</ul>
<p>B-tree is a balanced <span>m-way</span> tree where <span>m</span> defines the order of the tree. Till now, we read that the node contains only one key but b-tree can have more than one key, and more than 2 children. It always maintains the sorted data. In binary tree, it is possible that leaf nodes can be at different levels, but in b-tree, all the leaf nodes must be at the same level.</p>
<p><span>If order is m then node has the following properties:</span></p>
<ul class="points">
<li>Each node in a b-tree can have maximum <span>m</span> children</li>
<li>For minimum children, a leaf node has 0 children, root node has minimum 2 children and internal node has minimum ceiling of m/2 children. For example, the value of m is 5 which means that a node can have 5 children and internal nodes can contain maximum 3 children.</li>
<li>Each node has maximum (m-1) keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>The root node must contain minimum 1 key and all other nodes must contain atleast <span>ceiling of m/2 minus 1</span> keys.</p>

<h3>Stack:</h3>
In the pushdown stacks only two operations are allowed: push the item into the stack, and pop the item out of the stack. A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top. push adds an item to the top of the stack, pop removes the item from the top. A helpful analogy is to think of a stack of books; you can remove only the top book, also you can add a new book on the top.<a class="thumbnail" href="https://everythingcomputerscience.com/images/stackImg.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="img-responsive" src="https://everythingcomputerscience.com/images/stackImg.jpg" /></a></div>

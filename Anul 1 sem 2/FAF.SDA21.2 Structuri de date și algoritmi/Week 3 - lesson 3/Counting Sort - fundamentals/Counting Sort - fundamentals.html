<p><span>Counting Sort is a linear sorting algorithm with asymptotic complexity O(n+k)</span>, which was found by Harold Seward in 1954.<br />Counting Sort is very time efficient and stable algorithm for sorting. Unlike bubble sort and merge sort, counting sort is not a comparison based algorithm. It avoids comparisons and exploits the O(1) time insertions and lookup in an array.</p>
<p>Counting Sort algorithm works on the keys that are small integer and lies between a specific range. It functions by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value. Then it uses some arithmetic calculation to place each key value into a sorted sequence.<br /><span>Its running time is O(Maximum key value – Minimum key value) which is linear</span>. So it is useful only when a difference is not large.</p>

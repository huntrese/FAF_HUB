<h6 class="toc" id="what-is-quick-sort"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Quick sort algorithm is one of the most widely used sorting algorithms. It follows a divide and conquer paradigm. We usually use Recursion in quicksort implementation. In each recursive call, a pivot is chosen, then the array is partitioned in such a way that all the elements less than pivot lie to the left and all the elements greater than pivot lie to the right.</span></h6>
<h6>After every call, the chosen pivot occupies its correct position in the array which it is supposed to as in a sorted array. So with each step, our problem gets reduced by 2 which leads to quick sorting. Pivot can be an element. Example: last element of the current array or the first element of current array or random pivot etc.</h6>
